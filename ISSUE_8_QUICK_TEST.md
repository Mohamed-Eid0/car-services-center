## 🔍 Browser Console Check

After each test, check browser console (F12):

### Test 1 (Multiple Cars):
```
✅ No errors
✅ Creates 2 separate client records (same phone)
✅ Creates 2 separate car records
```

### Test 2 (Ownership Transfer):
```
✅ Console log: "Plate CAR999 already exists but with different owner - allowing registration"
✅ Creates 2 separate client records
✅ Creates 2 car records with same plate
```

### Test 3 (Exact Duplicate):
```
❌ API error caught
✅ Error message displayed to user
✅ No duplicate created
```

---

## 📊 Database Verification

Check localStorage in browser DevTools (Application → Local Storage):

### After Test 1:
```json
clients: [
  { id: 1, first_name: "Ahmed", last_name: "Ali", phone: "01234567890" },
  { id: 2, first_name: "Ahmed", last_name: "Ali", phone: "01234567890" }
]

cars: [
  { id: 1, client_id: 1, plate: "ABC123", brand: "Toyota" },
  { id: 2, client_id: 2, plate: "XYZ789", brand: "Honda" }
]
```

### After Test 2:
```json
clients: [
  { id: 1, first_name: "Ahmed", last_name: "Ali", phone: "01234567890" },
  { id: 2, first_name: "Mohamed", last_name: "Hassan", phone: "09876543210" }
]

cars: [
  { id: 1, client_id: 1, plate: "CAR999", brand: "BMW" },
  { id: 2, client_id: 2, plate: "CAR999", brand: "BMW" }
]
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

All 3 tests pass if:

1. ✅ Test 1: Two rows appear in Recorded Clients for phone 01234567890
2. ✅ Test 2: Two rows appear in Recorded Clients for plate CAR999
3. ❌ Test 3: Error message appears, no duplicate created

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Phone/Plate "already exists" error appears unexpectedly
**Fix**: Clear localStorage and try again:
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### Issue: No error message on exact duplicate
**Check**:
1. Verify client_id is same in both attempts
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Ensure testApi.js changes were saved

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Phone numbers can repeat**: One person, multiple cars
- **Plate numbers can repeat**: One car, multiple owners (over time)
- **Only exact duplicates are blocked**: Same client_id + same plate
- **Service history preserved**: Both ownership records remain in system
